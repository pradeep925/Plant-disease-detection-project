# Plant-disease-detection-project
The Plant Disease Detection project aims to identify and classify plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning techniques. Leveraging a publicly available Kaggle dataset containing thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
